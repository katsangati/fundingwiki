The aim of this package is to provide a two-way connection between
Innovations in Fundraising Wiki_ and an Airtable database.
The database stores part of the content that is published on the Wiki: mostly structured content such as evidence for
particular innovation tools and bibliographic references. The package provides a way to access this content in the
database and post it to the Wiki in various formats, i.e. as tables, pages or forms that can be filled in by users that
wish to contribute.

Currently only the database-to-wiki connection is implemented. That is, all the changes to the database-driven content
need to be done inside the database and then pushed to the wiki. In the future we plan to implement a wiki-to-database
connection that would allow content from the wiki to be pushed to the database.
